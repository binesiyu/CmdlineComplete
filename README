When editing the command-line (: / etc.), press TAB or S-TAB to complete the
word before the cursor, using keywords in the current file. E.g: you want to
search for "elephant" in the buffer, just type /ele and press TAB. So long as "elephant" is in the buffer, you will get "ele" completed into "elephant".
